# CapeMay

This application is my first multi screen encounter in the Android World. This application was built to test my skills 
with respect to building a multi screen application. At the time of building this application, I was going to a trip to 
Cape May and we used this application to quickly locate the points of interest. The application consists of multiple 
list views with each of them listing different places separated by type of locations.
